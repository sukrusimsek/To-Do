# To-Do
In this project, I made a To-Do app using MVVM architecture. 
Each task recorded in the app is stored in the phone's own memory with CoreData. I also created a filtering model with SearchBar and scopes in the app. There are 4 different standard task types in this filter. Apart from these, I activated the use of SearchBar to search and find the saved #tags.  I developed it completely programmatically.
